# AIRLINE-PASSENGER-TIME-SERIES-PREDICTION

Aim of the project:
Given the number of passengers (in units of thousands) for last two months, 
what is the number of passengers next month? In order to solve this problem 
we will build a LSTM model and train this model with our train data which is first 100 months in our dataset. 
After the LSTM model training finishes and learn the pattern in time series train data, we will ask it the above question question and get the answer from it.
